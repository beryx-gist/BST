# What is in this folder?
In this folder, you will find some useful files :

* An `examples` folder containing most of the examples from the tutorial 
* The tutorial, in both ODT and PDF form (do note the PDF form is not always up to date
* A "Requires OpenBST" badge to use anywhere you want
* A .lang file. If you use a GTK editor (this is the case on most linux platforms) that uses GTKSourceView (gedit, mousepad, pluma...), you can put this file in `/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs` to automatically get highlighting in your BST files.
