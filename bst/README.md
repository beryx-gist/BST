# What is in this folder?
In this folder, you will find some useful files :

* The tutorial, in both ODT and PDF form (do note the PDF form is not always up to date)
* The reference sheet, in both ODS and PDF form (do note the PDF form is not always up to date)
* A .lang file. If you use a GTK editor (this is the case on most linux platforms) that uses GTKSourceView (gedit, mousepad, pluma...), you can put this file in `/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs` to automatically get highlighting in your BST files. **This lang file is severely outdated. An Atom plugin is being created.**
* A shell script to execute to automatically create a .pdf from the .odt file as long as LibreOffice is installed
