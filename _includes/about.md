### BST
BST is a simple, straight-forward language built from the ground up to provide the most user-friendly clutter-free experience possible to both users and story creators. Creating BST files simply requires any text file editor : Windows' Notepad.exe, Notepad++, gedit, Mousepad, Pluma, Atom.io, Sublime Text, any can do!

```
1:This small text box is all you need to know to get started
:Cool!|2

2:I know right? :D
```

And you can even create more complex story with scripting. Heck, you could even create your very own text-based game with it -- your imagination is the limit.

The BST format is open, and documentation is available freely to download from the Release page.

### OpenBST
OpenBST is a simple, cross-platform and universal program to read and interact with any BST formatted file. It aims to be up to date with the latest new fancy features.

Its interface is simple enough for newcomers while containing everything needed for power users and story creators.
