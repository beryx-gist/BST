<p>BST is a language that allows you to create branching stories and small text-based games. It is made to be as simple and straightforward as possible, but still be powerful. Creating BST files only requires a simple text file editor : Windowsâ€™ Notepad.exe, Notepad++, gedit, Mousepad, Pluma, Atom.io, Sublime Text, any can do!</p>

<pre><code>1:This small text box is all you need to know to get started
:Cool!|2
:Not cool!|3

2:I know right? :)

3:Well that's rude
</code></pre>

<p>But BST isn't only just this : it has a scripting mechnism, sounds, interface customization, and more!</p>

<p>The BST format is open, and documentation is available from the Download section of the website. By itself, your text file won't do anything. Much like an image file, you'll need some program to open it.</p>
