<p>BST is a simple, straight-forward language built from the ground up to provide the most user-friendly clutter-free experience possible to both users and story creators. Creating BST files only requires a simple text file editor : Windows’ Notepad.exe, Notepad++, gedit, Mousepad, Pluma, Atom.io, Sublime Text, any can do!</p>

<pre><code>1:This small text box is all you need to know to get started
:Cool!|2
:Not cool!|3

2:I know right? :)

3:Well that's rude
</code></pre>

<p>And you can even create more complex stories with scripting. Heck, you could even create your very own text-based game with it – your imagination is the limit.</p>

<p>The BST format is open, and documentation is available from the Download section of the website.</p>
