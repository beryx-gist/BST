Yeah, perfect timing, April fools and stuff, I know. Yet, there is something that I need to talk about. *BST isn't dead*.

Development has been pretty quiet, I'll admit it. The main reason for this lack of activity is mostly just lack of motivation -- it's hard to fully focus on a project when no one uses it in the end. How do I know no one uses it? Easy, I put a download shield showing the total downloads of BST and all the documentation stuff. This number hasn't changed for more than two months. Really, no one cares.

I hope to release BST 1.1 in a few weeks. It is mostly a massive bugfix, stability release, with an additional feature and an updated documentation (that hasn't been released yet, I'm working on it). Everything seems to work, I just need to do more testing.

Other than that, nothing else to say really. I am still a huge beginner in HTML (and this website is based off a heavily modified Jekyll theme that I lost the URL of and am too lazy to find the source.)

**The best thing you can do to help the BST project is by spreading the word!** It's super important!
