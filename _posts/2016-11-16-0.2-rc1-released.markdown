The first Release Candidate of OpenBST is out! Check out the full description [here][relpage]! The main difference you will notice is the new interface. Some bugfixing is required on it, but other than that, it is pretty stable!

The Tutorial was updated too! It is now fully complete with the BST language. More details will be added when BST will reach 1.0 with plugin compatibility.
