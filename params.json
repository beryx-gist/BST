  "body": "# BST\r\nBST is a simple, straight-forward language built from the ground up to provide the most user-friendly clutter-free experience possible to both users and story creators. Creating BST files simply requires any text file editor : Windows' Notepad.exe, Notepad++, gedit, Mousepad, Pluma, Atom.io, Sublime Text, any can do!\r\n\r\n```\r\n1:This small text box is all you need to know to get started\r\n:Cool!|2\r\n\r\n2:I know right? :D\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you can even create more complex story with scripting. Heck, you could even create your very own text-based game with it -- your imagination is the limit.\r\n\r\nThe BST format is open, and documentation is available freely to download from the Release page.\r\n\r\n# OpenBST\r\nOpenBST is a simple, cross-platform and universal program to read and interact with any BST formatted file.
