Branching Story Tree, or BST for short, is a Turing complete language that allows you to create branching stories easily, with scripting capabilities.

This repository contains :

* The **official BST tutorial and documentation** (specification TBD)
* The **OpenBST Player**, a simple program for playing .bst files easily
* The **BST-Java library**, a simple library that reads and understand .bst files.

A simplistic player for any BST file.

## BST-Java

Java implementation of the BST language. Very easy to use. Do note that it tends to be very laxist regarding syntax, and not descriptive for crashes. It is up to the application built upon it to provide more details.
