Further development of features should always be done on the feature
branch itself.

DOWNLOADING FROM STABLE
Simply download the latest release

DOWNLOADING FROM DEV (generally unstable)
Use the following commands :

    git clone -b dev https://github.com/utybo/BST
    cd BST
    gradle run

NEVER DOWNLOAD FROM A FEATURE BRANCH!
Feature branches are considered to be in-development features. They
are, by definition, very unstable. Bottom line : NEVER use them in
production!
Feature branches are directly related to an issue most of the time.
Discussion of the feature should go in that issue.
